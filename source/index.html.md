# Introduction

Welcome to Executive Sentiment API! You can use our API to access stockâ€™s fundamental data, including company reviews and company executive analysis.

We have language bindings in Shell, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

Base URL: `/v1/`


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```python
import sentiment

api = sentiment.authorize('YOUR API KEY')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl https://api.executivesentiment.com/v1/ \
  -H "YOUR API KEY"
```

```javascript
const sentiment = require('sentiment');

let api = sentiment.authorize('YOUR API KEY');

The Executive Sentiment API uses API Keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Dashboard.
